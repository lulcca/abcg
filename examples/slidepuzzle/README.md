<br />

The <strong>[Slide Puzzle](https://lulcca.github.io/abcg/slidepuzzle/)</strong> is a game whose objective is to form the correct sequence with limited movements, using the empty space.

<br />

To win, you need to form the sequence and the empty block must always be at the last spot (`bottom right`). The game has two difficulties, `easy` and `hard`. It's also possible to restart the game by pressing `restart` at any time, shuffling the board again.
