The <strong>[Snake Game](https://lulcca.github.io/abcg/snakegame/)</strong> is a game whose objective is to eat the apples, without hitting the border or yourself. You must eat 12 apples to win!

<br />

For more implementation and logic information, I recommend checking the comments in the file [snakegame/window.cpp](https://github.com/lulcca/abcg/blob/main/examples/snakegame/window.cpp)
